| -----------                           | -----------  |
| Admission controller	                | Code that validates or mutates resources to enforce policies. Runs as part of the API admission chain immediately after authentication and authorization.  |
| Annotation                            | Object metadata that can be used to expose alpha or beta capabilities or integrate with third-party systems.                                               |
| API                                   | Application Programming Interface. In the case of Kubernetes, all resources are defined in the API, which is RESTful and exposed via the API server.       |
| API group                             | A set of related API resources. For example, networking resources are usually located in the networking.k8s.io API group.                                  |
| API resource                          | All Kubernetes objects, such as Pods, Deployments, and Services, are defined in the API as resources.                                                      |
| API Server                            | Exposes the API on a secure port over HTTPS. Runs on the control plane.                                                                                    |
| Cloud controller manager	            |Control plane service that integrates with the underlying cloud platform. For example, when creating a LoadBalancer Service, the cloud controller manager implements the logic to provision one of the underlying cloudâ€™s internet-facing load balancers.                                                                                                                 |
